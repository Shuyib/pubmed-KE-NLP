This is a Text mining and text summarization project from 1980 - 2019. The purpose is to see the research topic direction by looking at several publications from Kenyan authors whose publications are in PubMed. Using Natural language processing techniques that is, finding out the most common words from several topics that emerge from titles of the publications using word clouds (Unigrams) and Latent Dirichlet allocation to explore if topic modelling would be help us reveal any insights.

We discovered:
A lot of studies are centered around Malaria, HIV and diarrheal disease. These are the main causes of mortality in Kenya referencing the [CDC Kenya website](https://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/countries/kenya/default.htm) now or in the past. It was fascinating that whoever replicates this study can confirm this.
